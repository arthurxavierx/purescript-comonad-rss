# purescript-comonad-rss

RSS feed reader written for the second part of my bachelor thesis: [A Real-World Application with a Comonadic User Interface](https://arthurxavierx.github.io/RealWorldAppComonadicUI.pdf), which features an extension of the model presented by Phil Freeman on [Declarative UIs are the Future â€” And the Future is Comonadic!](http://functorial.com/the-future-is-comonadic/main.pdf) with support for asynchronous effects in response to user interaction and composition of components with powerful communication schemes.
